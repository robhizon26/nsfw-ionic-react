NSFW JS is originally from [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red/). I wrapped the [web app](https://nsfwjs.com/) using Ionic React so that I can use the device camera seamlessly

NSFW(Not Safe for Work) JS is an app that uses TensorflowJS (hence the suffix JS) to classify images if it safe to view at work or not. This is particularly checking on pornography images.

You can check out their original source code [here](https://github.com/infinitered/nsfwjs).
